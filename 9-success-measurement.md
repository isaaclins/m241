## Step 9: Measure Success (`Erfolgsmessung`)

To measure the success of the MatchWork platform, we have chosen the method of tracking **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**. These metrics provide a clear, data-driven view of our performance against key objectives.

### Key Performance Indicators for MatchWork

We will group our KPIs into two main categories: **User Engagement** and **Platform Health**.

**1. User Engagement KPIs (Are people actively using the app?)**

- **Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU):** Measures the overall size and growth of our user base.
- **Swipes per User:** Tracks engagement with the core swipe mechanic.
- **Match Rate:** The percentage of right swipes that result in a mutual match. This is a key indicator of the AI algorithm's effectiveness.
- **Messages per Match:** Measures how many matches lead to a real conversation, indicating the quality of the matches.

**2. Platform Health KPIs (Is the platform sustainable and effective?)**

- **Job Seeker to Recruiter Ratio:** A critical metric for the health of our two-sided marketplace.
- **Time to First Match:** How long it takes a new user to get their first match. A shorter time equals a better initial experience.
- **User Retention Rate:** The percentage of users who return to the app over time. This is a strong indicator of product-market fit.
- **(Hypothetical) Conversion Rate:** In a real-world scenario, this would track the percentage of free recruiter accounts that upgrade to a paid plan.

### Grug Summary

how we know if app good? we look at numbers. numbers not lie.

- **Are people using it?** we count how many grugs use app each day. we count how many times they swipe. we count how many matches they get. more is good.
- **Is app working?** we check if enough jobs for job grugs. we check if users come back tomorrow. if they come back, app is not bad.

if numbers go up, we do good job. if numbers go down, we do bad job and need fix. simple.
