## Step 8: Market Research

To validate our assumptions and understand the competitive landscape, we have developed a plan for primary and secondary market research. This plan outlines the methods we would use if this were a commercial project.

### 1. Primary Research (`Primärforschung`)

- **Method:** Online Survey.
- **Target Audience:** Students in tech-related fields and recent graduates.
- **Justification:** A survey is a cost-effective method to gather direct feedback on our core concepts. We would use a free tool like Google Forms.
- **Key Survey Questions We Would Ask:**
  1.  How frustrating do you find the current job application process? (Scale 1-10)
  2.  What is your biggest frustration with platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed?
  3.  How important is seeing a salary range before applying? (Scale: Not important to Essential)
  4.  Does a "Tinder-like" swipe interface for jobs sound appealing? (Yes/No/Maybe)
  5.  What is the one feature you wish job-finding apps had?

### 2. Secondary Research (`Sekundärforschung`)

- **Method:** Competitor and Online Research.
- **Justification:** This allows us to learn from existing products and market trends without reinventing the wheel.
- **Research Targets:**
  1.  **Direct Competitors:** Analyze apps like "Hired" and "Bumble Bizz" to understand their feature set, pricing, and user feedback.
  2.  **Indirect Competitors:** Study market leaders like LinkedIn to identify their weaknesses (e.g., application "black hole," lack of transparency) that MatchWork can solve.
  3.  **Market Trends:** Research articles on "recruitment technology," "the future of work," and "Gen Z workplace expectations" to confirm our strategic direction.

### Grug Summary

we not build in dark. we open eyes first. that is research.

- **Primary Research:** we make simple questions. ask other student grugs: "you hate job hunt? what part bad? you want salary number? you like swipey app?" their answers tell us if idea is good.
- **Secondary Research:** we look at other job apps. what they do good? what they do bad? we learn from their mistakes. we also read what big brains say about future of jobs.

this way, we build smart thing, not dumb thing.
