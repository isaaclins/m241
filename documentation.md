# M241 Project Documentation

## Step 1: Develop an Innovative Idea

After brainstorming several concepts, we have decided to pursue **"MatchWork"**, a modern career platform designed to streamline and improve the job-seeking process.

### The Core Concept

MatchWork is inspired by the "Tinder for Jobs" model. It is a mobile-first platform that facilitates a **mutual, double opt-in matching system** between job candidates and recruiters.

- **Candidates** create a detailed profile by uploading their CV, which is automatically parsed into skills, experience, and education. They can further enhance their profile with personal preferences and a bio.
- **Recruiters** post job listings with clear role descriptions and a **mandatory salary range** to ensure transparency.
- A **"Match"** occurs only when a candidate expresses interest in a job (swipes right) AND a recruiter expresses interest in that candidate. This match immediately opens a direct communication channel (chat) between both parties.

### Key Innovations

The project's innovation lies in directly addressing the primary frustrations of the traditional job market:

1.  **Eliminating the "Application Black Hole":** The mutual matching system ensures that candidates only connect with companies that are genuinely interested, ending the practice of sending applications into a void.
2.  **AI-Powered Intelligent Matching:** The platform will use an AI algorithm that goes beyond simple keyword matching. It learns from user behavior (both candidate and recruiter) to refine the feed of potential jobs and candidates, improving the quality and relevance of suggestions over time.
3.  **Enforced Transparency:** By making salary range a required field for all job postings, the platform saves time for both parties and fosters a more open and fair hiring environment.
4.  **Focus on Quality over Quantity:** MatchWork prioritizes creating a small number of high-quality, relevant connections over enabling mass, impersonal job applications.

This concept forms the foundation of our M241 project.

## Step 2: Create a Business Model Canvas

We have created a Business Model Canvas to map out the structure of MatchWork, focusing on a zero-cost model suitable for a student project.

### Business Model Canvas: MatchWork (Student Project Edition)

1.  **Customer Segments:**

    - **Job Seekers:** Tech-savvy students and professionals (e.g., in IT, marketing, design) who value efficiency and transparency.
    - **Businesses/Recruiters:** Companies, especially startups and tech firms, looking for efficient ways to find talent.

2.  **Value Propositions:**

    - **For Job Seekers:** A fast, transparent, and engaging way to find relevant job opportunities without the frustration of the "application black hole."
    - **For Businesses:** Access to a curated pool of interested candidates via an AI-powered matching system, reducing hiring time.

3.  **Channels:**

    - **Mobile App:** The primary channel (iOS/Android), developed with a cross-platform framework.
    - **Web Platform:** A responsive web app deployed for free on platforms like Vercel.
    - **Organic Marketing:** Social media (LinkedIn, etc.), word-of-mouth, and content marketing.

4.  **Customer Relationships:**

    - **Automated & Self-Service:** The platform is designed to be entirely self-service.
    - **Community & Support:** A simple FAQ page and a link to a GitHub repository for feedback.

5.  **Revenue Streams (Hypothetical):**

    - For this academic exercise, the platform operates at zero cost and generates no revenue. A hypothetical model would be **Freemium for Recruiters**, while always remaining **100% free for Job Seekers.**

6.  **Key Activities:**

    - **Platform Development & Maintenance:** Building and improving the app, website, and the core AI matching algorithm.
    - **Community Building:** Encouraging adoption through organic channels.
    - **Data Security:** Ensuring user data is handled securely.

7.  **Key Resources:**

    - **The Platform/Codebase:** The core intellectual property being built.
    - **Development Team:** Our project group.
    - **Free-Tier Cloud Infrastructure:** Using services with generous free tiers like **Vercel** (frontend), **Render** (backend), and **Supabase/Firebase** (database/auth).

8.  **Key Partnerships:**

    - **University Career Services:** Partnering with universities to onboard students.
    - **Tech Communities:** Engaging with online developer communities to attract early adopters.

9.  **Cost Structure:**
    - As a student project, all real-world costs are **$0**.
    - **Personnel Costs:** $0 (Effort from the project team).
    - **Infrastructure Costs:** $0 (Strictly using free tiers of services).
    - **Marketing & Sales Costs:** $0 (Focusing on organic growth).
