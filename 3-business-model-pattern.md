## Step 3: Choose a Business Model Pattern

We have selected the **"Freemium"** pattern from the St. Gallen Business Model Navigator as the most suitable model for MatchWork.

### 1. What is the Freemium Pattern?

The Freemium pattern involves offering a basic version of a product or service for free, while charging for a premium version with advanced features, functionality, or benefits. The free offering attracts a large user base, which can then be converted to paying customers for the premium services.

### 2. Why does this pattern fit MatchWork?

- **Reduces Barrier to Entry:** To solve the "chicken-and-egg" problem in a two-sided market (where you need job seekers to attract recruiters, and vice-versa), the free offering is crucial. It allows both sides to join and see value without any initial financial commitment.
- **Value-Based Upsell:** The model aligns perfectly with our customer segments. The free tier offers enough value for a small company, but larger companies with greater hiring needs will require the features of a premium subscription. The revenue model is tied directly to the value a business derives from the platform.
- **Free for Job Seekers:** It aligns with our core principle that the platform must always be free for the individual. The cost is placed on the side with commercial intent (the hiring company).

### 3. How is it implemented in MatchWork?

- **Free Version:** All Job Seekers get full access for free. Recruiters can post a limited number of jobs and access basic matching features for free.
- **Premium Version (Hypothetical):** For a subscription fee, recruiters would unlock features like unlimited job postings, advanced candidate filters, company branding, and an analytics dashboard.
