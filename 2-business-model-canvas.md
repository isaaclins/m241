## Step 2: Create a Business Model Canvas

We have created a Business Model Canvas to map out the structure of MatchWork, focusing on a zero-cost model suitable for a student project.

### Business Model Canvas: MatchWork (Student Project Edition)

1.  **Customer Segments:**

    - **Job Seekers:** Tech-savvy students and professionals (e.g., in IT, marketing, design) who value efficiency and transparency.
    - **Businesses/Recruiters:** Companies, especially startups and tech firms, looking for efficient ways to find talent.

2.  **Value Propositions:**

    - **For Job Seekers:** A fast, transparent, and engaging way to find relevant job opportunities without the frustration of the "application black hole."
    - **For Businesses:** Access to a curated pool of interested candidates via an AI-powered matching system, reducing hiring time.

3.  **Channels:**

    - **Mobile App:** The primary channel (iOS/Android), developed with a cross-platform framework.
    - **Web Platform:** A responsive web app deployed for free on platforms like Vercel.
    - **Organic Marketing:** Social media (LinkedIn, etc.), word-of-mouth, and content marketing.

4.  **Customer Relationships:**

    - **Automated & Self-Service:** The platform is designed to be entirely self-service.
    - **Community & Support:** A simple FAQ page and a link to a GitHub repository for feedback.

5.  **Revenue Streams (Hypothetical):**

    - For this academic exercise, the platform operates at zero cost and generates no revenue. A hypothetical model would be **Freemium for Recruiters**, while always remaining **100% free for Job Seekers.**

6.  **Key Activities:**

    - **Platform Development & Maintenance:** Building and improving the app, website, and the core AI matching algorithm.
    - **Community Building:** Encouraging adoption through organic channels.
    - **Data Security:** Ensuring user data is handled securely.

7.  **Key Resources:**

    - **The Platform/Codebase:** The core intellectual property being built.
    - **Development Team:** Our project group.
    - **Free-Tier Cloud Infrastructure:** Using services with generous free tiers like **Vercel** (frontend), **Render** (backend), and **Supabase/Firebase** (database/auth).

8.  **Key Partnerships:**

    - **University Career Services:** Partnering with universities to onboard students.
    - **Tech Communities:** Engaging with online developer communities to attract early adopters.

9.  **Cost Structure:**
    - As a student project, all real-world costs are **$0**.
    - **Personnel Costs:** $0 (Effort from the project team).
    - **Infrastructure Costs:** $0 (Strictly using free tiers of services).
    - **Marketing & Sales Costs:** $0 (Focusing on organic growth).
