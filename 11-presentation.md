## Step 11: Presentation (`Pr√§sentationstechnik`)

For our final presentation, we have chosen the **Storytelling** technique to present our project in a compelling and memorable way.

### The Presentation Story Arc

Our presentation will follow a classic narrative structure to engage the audience emotionally and logically.

1.  **The Hook (The Problem):**
    We will begin with a short, fictional story to make the problem relatable.

    _"Let me tell you about my friend, Handro. He's a brilliant developer, but after being laid off, his job search has been demoralizing. Every day, he sends applications into a digital black hole, never knowing if they were seen, if the salary was right, or why he was rejected. His confidence is fading, not because of his skills, but because the process is broken. Handro's story is why we created MatchWork."_

2.  **The Inciting Incident (The Idea):**
    We'll introduce MatchWork as the answer to Handro's problems. We will highlight the core concepts: the mutual match system, mandatory salary transparency, and the AI-powered engine.

3.  **The Journey (The Process):**
    This section will briefly showcase our diligent work throughout the M241 module. We will visually present artifacts from our project, such as the Business Model Canvas, the PESTEL analysis, and our SWOT analysis, to demonstrate the structured approach we took.

4.  **The Climax (The Solution):**
    Here, we will present the visual prototype of the MatchWork app. We will walk the audience through the user flow using the AI-generated screens, showing them exactly how MatchWork solves the problems Handro faced.

5.  **The Resolution (The Future & Conclusion):**
    We will conclude by summarizing the key innovations and how they create a better future for job seekers. We will briefly mention our success metrics (KPIs) and our awareness of the risks, showing that we have a clear and realistic vision. We'll end with a powerful concluding statement about the future of finding a meaningful career.
